# GLOSSARY ENTRIES

 **Confidentiality** is when a system is capable of distiguishing between 
users and granting access to certain _assets_ only to autorized persons 
who have the right credetials to access them.  

 > "Information is only available to those who should have access to it. 
Improper authentication, unauthorized access, information exposure all 
lead to a breach of confidentiality. The more sensitive the information 
held within an application, the more serious this goal is."
>
> (Buttner & Shields, 2014)

 **Integerity** is the ability of a computer system to make sure that 
certain assests are modified or deleted only by certan authorized users, 
and that no unauthorized user will ba able to tamper with it.  
> "Data is known to be correct and trusted.
>
>Integrity involves making sure that information is correct and hasn't 
been altered. The more important the role of the application, the more 
important it is for its information to be trusted as decisions are made 
based on this information. If a malicious user can change the 
information, then they can affect the decisions being made." 
>
>(Buttner & Shields, 2014)

 **Availabilty** is ensuring that assets are _always_ available for use 
by authorised persons.  
> "Information is available for use by legitimate users when it is 
needed.
>
>Availability is concerned with the ability of a user to access the 
application and complete their mission. If the information in an 
application is not available, then decisions that are based on this 
information can  not be made." 
>
>(Buttner & Shields, 2014)

 **Authentication** is when a system is capable of confirming the 
identity of a user, and making sure that the user attempting to use the 
system is who they claim to be, and not an imposter.  
> Accountability is "the security goal that generates the requirement for 
actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity. This supports 
non-repudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and 
prevention, and after-action recovery and legal action."
>
>(NIST, 2013)
