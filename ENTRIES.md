 **Confidentiality** is when a system is capable of distiguishing between 
users and granting access to certain _assets_ only to autorized persons 
who have the right credetials to access them.  

 > "Information is only available to those who should have access to it. 
Improper authentication, unauthorized access, information exposure all 
lead to a breach of confidentiality. The more sensitive the information 
held within an application, the more serious this goal is."
