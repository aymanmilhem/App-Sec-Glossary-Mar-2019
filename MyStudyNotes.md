## **IT Security Best Practices/ Security Principles**

3. **Assign Minimum Privileges**  
4. **Use Independent Defenses**  
5. **Plan for Failure**

7. **Run Frequent Tests**  

> ### **The Takeaway**
>
>IT security is a challenging job that requires attention to detail at 
the same time as it demands a higher-level awareness. However, like many 
tasks that seem complex at first glance, IT security can be broken down 
in to basic steps that can simplify the process. Thatâ€™s not to say it 
makes things easy, but it does keep IT professionals on their toes. 

> ## Important
>In the **Written Assessment**, you will be asked to explain three 
principles 
of your choice (except Defense in Depth) and then analyse one of those in 
more detail. 


> **Bingo**!!
